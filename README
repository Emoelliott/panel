Thanks for choosing radiPanel RC2!

To install, simply upload using FTP or a file transfer program of your choice,
create a MySQL database and visit the _installer directory - it's all downhill
from there!

Things to note:
- In order for a user to be able to view the panel, he *must* have the "User"
  usergroup selected - without it he'll be unable to access the core functions
  of the script!

- All frontend files are located in _frontend - they're deliberately simple
  and therefore easy to integrate into your site. Should you need any assistance
  with these just contact Josh on ClubHabbo Forum.

That's it - it's really that simple. Thanks again for choosing radiPanel - enjoy!
